helpText['default-style'] = [[
Default style that is applied to all UI elements. A string of ASS override tags.
Individual elements have their own style settings which override the tags here.
Changing the font will likely require changing the hover-time margin settings
and the offscreen-pos settings.

Here are some useful ASS override tags (omit square brackets):
\fn[Font Name]: sets the font to the named font.
\fs[number]: sets the font size to the given number.
\b[1/0]: sets the text bold or not (\b1 is bold, \b0 is regular weight).
\i[1/0]: sets the text italic or not (same semantics as bold).
\bord[number]: sets the outline width to the given number (in pixels).
\shad[number]: sets the shadow size to the given number (pixels).
\c&H[BBGGRR]&: sets the fill color for the text to the given color (hex pairs in
	             the order, blue, green, red).
\3c&H[BBGGRR]&: sets the outline color of the text to the given color.
\4c&H[BBGGRR]&: sets the shadow color of the text to the given color.
\alpha&H[AA]&: sets the line's transparency as a hex pair. 00 is fully opaque
               and FF is fully transparent. Some UI elements are composed of
               multiple layered lines, so adding transparency may not look good.
               For further granularity, \1a&H[AA]& controls the fill opacity,
               \3a&H[AA]& controls the outline opacity, and \4a&H[AA]& controls
               the shadow opacity.

helpText['bar-hide-inactive'] = [[
Causes the bar to not be drawn unless the mouse is hovering over it or a
request-display call is active. This is somewhat redundant with setting bar-
height-inactive=0, except that it can allow for very rudimentary context-
sensitive behavior because it can be toggled at runtime. For example, by using
the binding `f cycle pause; script-binding progressbar/toggle-inactive-bar`, it
is possible to have the bar be persistently present only in windowed or
fullscreen contexts, depending on the default setting.
]]

settings['bar-height-inactive'] = 3
helpText['bar-height-inactive'] = [[
Sets the height of the bar display when the mouse is not in the active zone and
there is no request-display active. A value of 0 or less will cause bar-hide-
inactive to be set to true and the bar height to be set to 1. This should result
in the desired behavior while avoiding annoying debug logging in mpv (libass
does not like zero-height objects).

helpText['seek-precision'] = [[
Affects precision of seeks due to clicks on the progress bar. Should be 'exact' or
'keyframes'. Exact is slightly slower, but won't jump around between two
different times when clicking in the same place.

Actually, this gets passed directly into the `seek` command, so the value can be
any of the arguments supported by mpv, though the ones above are the only ones
that really make sense.

settings['bar-background-adaptive'] = true
helpText['bar-background-adaptive'] = [[
Causes the progress bar background layer to automatically size itself to the

less than the bar height.

settings['bar-cache-position'] = 'overlay'
helpText['bar-cache-position'] = [[
Placement of the cache bar. Valid values are 'overlay' and 'underlay'.

'overlay' causes the cache bar to be drawn on top of the foreground layer of the
bar, allowing the display of seek ranges that have already been encountered.

'underlay' draws the cache bar between the foreground and background layers. Any
demuxer cache ranges that are prior to the current playback point will not be
shown. This matches the previous behavior.

Sets the height of the cache bar display when the mouse is not in the active

occludes) the progress bar.

position. The tags specified here are applied after bar-cache-style and override
them. Leaving this blank will leave the style the same as specified by bar-
