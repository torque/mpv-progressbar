# Default style that is applied to all UI elements. A string of ASS override tags.
# Individual elements have their own style settings which override the tags here.
# Changing the font will likely require changing the hover-time margin settings
# and the offscreen-pos settings.
# 
# Here are some useful ASS override tags (omit square brackets):
# \fn[Font Name]: sets the font to the named font.
# \fs[number]: sets the font size to the given number.
# \b[1/0]: sets the text bold or not (\b1 is bold, \b0 is regular weight).
# \i[1/0]: sets the text italic or not (same semantics as bold).
# \bord[number]: sets the outline width to the given number (in pixels).
# \shad[number]: sets the shadow size to the given number (pixels).
# \c&H[BBGGRR]&: sets the fill color for the text to the given color (hex pairs in
# 	             the order, blue, green, red).
# \3c&H[BBGGRR]&: sets the outline color of the text to the given color.
# \4c&H[BBGGRR]&: sets the shadow color of the text to the given color.
# \alpha&H[AA]&: sets the line's transparency as a hex pair. 00 is fully opaque
#                and FF is fully transparent. Some UI elements are composed of
#                multiple layered lines, so adding transparency may not look good.
#                For further granularity, \1a&H[AA]& controls the fill opacity,
#                \3a&H[AA]& controls the outline opacity, and \4a&H[AA]& controls
#                the shadow opacity.

# Controls whether or not the progress bar is drawn at all. If this is disabled,
# it also (naturally) disables the click-to-seek functionality.
enable-bar=yes

# Causes the bar to not be drawn unless the mouse is hovering over it or a
# request-display call is active. This is somewhat redundant with setting bar-
# height-inactive=0, except that it can allow for very rudimentary context-
# sensitive behavior because it can be toggled at runtime. For example, by using
# the binding `f cycle pause; script-binding progressbar/toggle-inactive-bar`, it
# is possible to have the bar be persistently present only in windowed or
# fullscreen contexts, depending on the default setting.
bar-hide-inactive=no

# Sets the height of the bar display when the mouse is not in the active zone and
# there is no request-display active. A value of 0 or less will cause bar-hide-
# inactive to be set to true and the bar height to be set to 1. This should result
# in the desired behavior while avoiding annoying debug logging in mpv (libass
# does not like zero-height objects).
bar-height-inactive=3

# Sets the height of the bar display when the mouse is in the active zone or
# request-display is active. There is no logic attached to this, so 0 or negative
# values may have unexpected results.

# If greater than zero, changes the progress bar style to be a small segment
# rather than a continuous bar and sets its width.
progress-bar-width=0

# Affects precision of seeks due to clicks on the progress bar. Should be 'exact' or
# 'keyframes'. Exact is slightly slower, but won't jump around between two
# different times when clicking in the same place.
# 
# Actually, this gets passed directly into the `seek` command, so the value can be
# any of the arguments supported by mpv, though the ones above are the only ones
# that really make sense.
seek-precision=exact

# Causes the progress bar background layer to automatically size itself to the
# tallest of the cache or progress bars. Useful for improving contrast but can
# make the bar take up more screen space. Has no effect if the cache bar height is
# less than the bar height.
bar-background-adaptive=yes

# Placement of the cache bar. Valid values are 'overlay' and 'underlay'.
# 
# 'overlay' causes the cache bar to be drawn on top of the foreground layer of the
# bar, allowing the display of seek ranges that have already been encountered.
# 
# 'underlay' draws the cache bar between the foreground and background layers. Any
# demuxer cache ranges that are prior to the current playback point will not be
# shown. This matches the previous behavior.
bar-cache-position=overlay

# Sets the height of the cache bar display when the mouse is not in the active
# zone and there is no request-display active. Useful in combination with bar-
# cache-position to control whether or not the cache bar is occluded by (or
# occludes) the progress bar.
bar-cache-height-inactive=1.5

# Sets the height of the cache bar display when the mouse is in the active zone or

# bar.
